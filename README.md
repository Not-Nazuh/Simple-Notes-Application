# Simple-Notes-Application
This is a simple notes application I made after thinking, why click someone elses notes application that works 50% of the time, when you can click your own notes application that works 51% of the time!

# How To Install

Download the entire repo and save it to a folder named whatever you like. after you've done that run the .exe and it should create a new folder called documents, if it does that then it means its working.
